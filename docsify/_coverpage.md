# The Two Realms

Your world, you've heard it said, just doesn't have as much mystery to it as it once had. Feels a little smaller, or so some say. Industry is on the rise, and in some circles coin and commerce begins to turn heads and hearts just as name and title does. "A mournful pity," the nobles cluck. "Opportunity," retort moneyed individuals. The poor man says nothing -- he labours on, regardless.

Technology, too, claims ground long held as bastions of the traditional, the privileged, the powerful. Errant knights lie dead, breastplates rent by lead shot and bodies twisted by cannon fire. Sulphur lingers in the air as the common man laughs. Mysticism is routed by medicine, mother's remedies are scorned and forgotten.

Seasons turn, a nation grows hungry. Grand interventions are launched, but by a nation half dull-eyed and half green-eyed. Ambition abounds, but to what ends?

War. Brother turns on brother, and cousin on cousin. Then peace, where wounds must be pressed shut and bridges rebuilt. For stability. Territory changes hands. Loyalties are broken, forged, tested, and mended.

The world turns. Stars mark their passage across the heavens. Some, below, watch their passage. But precious few, now.

The world is too small, and too immediate, to look to the stars.
